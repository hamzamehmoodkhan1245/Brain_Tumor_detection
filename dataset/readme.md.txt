# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using YOLOv11 and SAM2 (Segment Anything Model)

This project aims to detect and segment brain tumors from MRI images using two powerful deep learning techniques:

- **YOLOv11** (simulated using YOLOv8) for real-time object detection  
- **SAM2 (Segment Anything Model)** for precise tumor region segmentation
